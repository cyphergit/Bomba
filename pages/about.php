                    Bomba Stuzzichini e Aperitivi is the creation of husband and wife team Marc and Natalie Ferron.
                    From the earlier days as contestants on Channel 7's popular TV show My Kitchen Rules,
                    the couple has finally seen their vision of owning a restaurant become a reality.

                    Bomba Stuzzichini e Aperitivi offers customers more than just good Italian food,
                    it offers an Italian experience. With Natalie's Italian background and Marc's love of everything Italian,
                    a close knit family feel is what you will experience when visiting Bomba.
                    There's a buzz yet a feeling of warmth along with wonderful Italian cuisine and drinks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Family always deserves the best and that is why a lot of effort goes into ensuring 99% of the menu is
                    house-made with the care and respect our customers (family) deserve. Whether you're enjoying our
                    stuzzichini like our freshly baked thyme &amp; pink salt focaccia or Sicilian style Polpette w Sugo and Grana Padano.
                    Or maybe it's our Gnocchi ai Funghi. Preparing all this in house ensures
                    freshness and quality synonymous with classic Italian cooking.

                    classic Negroni to a 'Ciao Sophia' cocktail, guaranteed to make you close your eyes and think of a summer's day in Roma.
